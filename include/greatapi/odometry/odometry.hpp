        explaining encoderangoffset and globaloffset

        the heading which the global coordinates use is measured as the angle between the forwards direction of the bot to the global X axis
        in order to rotate the local coordinate grid to the global axis, we need to rotate by the angle between pairs of local axises and global axises
        so that both axises are parallel with each other. This would let us add the coordinates to each other. We can apply an offset to the heading
        indicated by the global coordinates to get the angle between local and global coordinate grids.

        globaloffset does this for us, as it's the offset from the forwards direction of the bot to the local X axis, which gets the angle between global and local

        there is also the edge case where the local Y axis isnt alligned with the forwards direction. Globaloffset doesn't account for this
        so we can add another variable which accounts for the Y axis being offset from the forwards direction.

        This variable is encoderangoffset.
